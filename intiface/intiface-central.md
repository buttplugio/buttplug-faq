# Intiface Central

## On Android, why will my bluetooth devices not connect?

There's currently a bug in Intiface Central that means errors are not thrown when system bluetooth is off. Check that your system bluetooth is turned on. If it's off, turn it on, and if the Intiface Central server is running, restart it.
