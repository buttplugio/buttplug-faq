# Kiiroo Devices

## Onyx+ / Realm Rey

The Onyx+ is one of a few devices that require pairing with the OS prior to Buttplug/Intiface being able to communicate with the device. In most cases, failure to do so will cause the device to be listed but it will not respond to commands.

To pair the Onyx, follow these steps:

1. Turn the Onyx off
2. Hold down the power button for 15 seconds (the led should flash rapidly to indicate when the pairing info has been reset)
3. Turn on the Onyx
4. Connect to the Onyx from the OS Bluetooth settings (it may be listed as Rey or Realm)
5. Once connected to the OS, turn off the Onyx
6. Turn on the Onyx, then scan for devices with Intiface or your preferred Buttplug Client (you should be able to connect and control the Onyx now)
