# The Handy

## How do I connect the Handy to Intiface/Buttplug?

To connect the Handy to Intiface/Buttplug:

- The Handy will need to have Firmware Version 3 or higher. Most devices are updated to that these
  days, but if you are using an older device, check that first.
- Make sure Bluetooth Device support is turned on for Intiface/Buttplug.
- Turn the device on, wait for the LED to go green.
- Hold the "WiFi" button until the LED turns blue.
- At this point, if Intiface/Buttplug is scanning, it should detect and connect to the Handy.
